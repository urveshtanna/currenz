# Currenz (A Currency Conversion App)

A simple android app that uses [Currency Layer api](https://currencylayer.com/) to convert currency to all the available currenices

**[Download APK](https://github.com/urveshtanna/currenz/blob/master/sample/app-debug.apk)**

## Features:
- A perfect grid layout of 3 columns which shows currency name and exchange value calculated from user's amount.
- Tapping on any of the grid item shows details of conversion like Name of currency, Exchange rate, Exchange value, Currency symbol and date as of which the exchange rate is calculated.
- User can sort the conversions based on Name, HIghest/Lowest exchange rate or by Symbol.
- It also supports searching of available currencies by name or symbol and choose one from them.
- Along with 30 mins of refreshing the live currency rate there is button to refresh the live rates manually.
- Functions are written in such way that with a single flag change API calls can be mocked and used for testing.
- And last not the least it also support Dark Mode ;) Dark Mode is enabled either if battery saver is on or by switching the mode in device settings (Android 10 and above).
